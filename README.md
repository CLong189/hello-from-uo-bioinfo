# hello-from-uo-bioinfo

This project is a platform for UO bioinformatics students to practice contributing
to a project on github. This is an exercise from a lecture found [here](zsailer.github.io/git-it-talk)

The exercise asks the students to add their own Python script that prints
```python
"Hello world from <github username>"
```

They are also asked to add their name to the `namelist.txt`.

The point of the exercise is to teach students how to:

1. Fork a repo.
2. Clone it.
3. Add a feature.
4. Push it to their forked repo.
5. Submit a pull request.
6. Address conflicts.
